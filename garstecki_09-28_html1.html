        <p>I am not entirely sure what to put on this website page so I will put a little bit about me and websites.</p>
        <h2>Designing Websites</h2>
        <p>I used to mess around with html all of the time, I even partly developed and edited my theme for my <span class="website">tumblr</span> site:</p>
        <img src="ss_for_ds_html.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Photography Tumblr Profile" />
        <p>That was years ago though, and now I can hardly remember any of it, which is really disappointing, because I need to learn html for things like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>photography</li>
            <li>videography</li>
        </ul>
        <p>which is what I want to do for my career one day. All of the professionals have a website, and designing one is free and you don't have to worry about copyright,
        which is why I am glad we are learning html.</p>
